I was the copywriter and content producer of a 40 page advertorial magazine for Foot Locker Europe that was translated to six languages and distributed in-store.

I managed a team of creatives to produce a completely new redesign, conceptual product shoots, editorial style portrait shots, feature articles copy and interviews.

To celebrate the one year anniversary of Sneakerpedia (powered by Foot Locker), I scripted, produced and directed the voiceover of this short promo video.
