Mr Porter teamed up with Fox Productions on the Michael Vaughn film *Kingsman: The Secret Service*, coming up with a premium collection of clothing, shoes and accessories for the modern gentleman. I worked on all marketing aspects, including but not limited to: photo shoots, a book, cloth tailor books, invitations and the launch of the collection at London Collections: Men.

Working to a short timescale, I worked on this shoot which was to be used as part of an interactive experience on the website. Working diligently with a Master Carpenter, we came up with this bespoke wardrobe to fit and highlight major collection pieces, whilst still ensuring a connection to the film's look and feel.
