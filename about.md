Hi, I’m Jess. I’m a London based freelance content strategist and copywriter who loves to create genuine and clever work that helps brands connect with their audiences. I’m a hard worker with a wide range of skills, from writing to production, delivering content for modern social audiences.

With more than 12 years’ experience covering a range of industries including fashion, lifestyle, travel, fintech and alcohol, you could say I’m pretty adaptable.

I’ve worked with some of the most loved and progressive brands in the world — adidas Originals, Mr Porter, Chandon, Starling Bank, and giffgaff, to name a few — and whether it’s a campaign, tone of voice guidelines or helping to build brand strategy, I love to be hands-on.

I feel just as comfortable leading a team as I do working independently, although I believe collaboration is key to good content.
