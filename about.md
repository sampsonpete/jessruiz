I'm a creative producer with a strong editorial background, having previous experience as a fashion writer and stylist.

I currently work at Mr Porter, the award-winning global retail destination for men's style, combining the best international menswear with editorial content. Prior to this I've worked with brands including adidas Originals, adidas (Performance), Thames & Hudson, Vans, Ben Sherman, Foot Locker EU and Defected Records to name a few.
